# Fast Fourier Transform Simulation

To create a linear chirp signal that sweeps from 350 kHz to 450 kHz and then perform the FFT to show its frequency domain, you can use the following Python code. 
Note that you'll need to adjust the sample rate and duration to appropriately represent this higher-frequency signal:
